    <h2>Character Name: Shang-Qung</h2>
    <p>Biography: Shang Tsung (尚宗)[2] is a character in the Mortal Kombat fighting game series.
        A powerful, soul stealing sorcerer,
        Shang Tsung is a celebrated villain of the series and served as the host for the traditional
        Mortal Kombat tournament in the original and alternate timelines. He serves as a major antagonist to the series,
        often serving as the secondary antagonist of the franchise alongside Quan Chi.

        Shang Tsung made his debut as one of the few original characters in the first Mortal Kombat arcade game,
        in which he served as the main antagonist and the unplayable final boss.
        He made his playable debut in Mortal Kombat II, where he serves as the secondary antagonist and sub-boss.
        He later serves as the titular antagonist of Mortal Kombat:
        Deadly Alliance alongside Quan Chi. He would return in the franchise's reboot, Mortal Kombat (2011),
        once again serving as the secondary antagonist alongside Quan Chi while being a secondary sub-boss
        before Kintaro and Goro in the Arcade.

        Shang Tsung returned in Mortal Kombat 11 as the guide in the game's Krypt and as a DLC character,
        being the first character available in the Kombat Pack. He later serves as the main antagonist of
        the Aftermath Story Mode expansion.</p>
